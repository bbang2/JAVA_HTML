		Last Christmas
	I gave you my heart
	But the very next day
	you gave it away
	This year
	to save me from tears
	I ll give it to someone special
	
	<details>**repeat
	Once bitten and twice shy
	I keep my distance,
	But you still catch my eye
	Tell me baby, Do you recognize me?
	Well, it s been a year, It doesn t surprise me
	Happy Christmas
	I wrapped it up and sent it
	With a note saying I love you I meant it
	Now I know what a fool I ve been
	But if you kissed me now
	I know you d fool me again
	</detail>
	<detail><pre>**repeat twice
	A crowded room,
	Friends with tired eyes
	I m hiding from you
	and your soul of ice
	My god I thought
	you were someone to rely on
	Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
	A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
	A man under cover but you tore me apart
	maybe next year I'll give it to someone
	I'll give it to someone special
